          <p style="font-size: 40px;">History of hyperlinks</p>
          <p>The history of hyperlinks can be traced back to the 1960s. As computer technology and the internet have
            evolved, so has the application and use of hyperlinks in the presentation and organization of material.
            Below is an overview of the history of hyperlinks, as well as their key technologies and applications at
            different times.</p>

          <div class="title">The Origin of Hyperlinks</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Concept proposal - The concept of hyperlinks was first proposed by Ted Nelson in 1965, who envisioned a
              global information space composed of hypertext in the "Xanadu" project.

            <li>Early Implementations - Douglas Engelbart implemented an early form of hyperlinks in the "Augment
              Project" in the late 1960s, demonstrating hypertext links for the first time in his 1968 "Mother of All
              Demos."

          <ul>
            <li>HTML and the World Wide Web - Hyperlinks truly became widespread with the invention of the World Wide
              Web (WWW) and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. In HTML, hyperlinks are
              implemented using the <a> tag, marking the beginning of widespread use of hyperlinks on the internet.

              <p>The Rise of Browsers - With the introduction of browsers like Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet
                Explorer, hyperlinks began to appear in richer forms, including image links and dynamic effects.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Styles and Interaction - The introduction of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allowed developers to
                customize the style of hyperlinks, including color, size, and mouse hover effects, enhancing user
                experience.</p>

              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Multimedia and Reactivity - The widespread use of JavaScript enabled hyperlinks to trigger complex
              behaviors, such as pop-up windows, animations, and real-time interactions with the server.</li>
            <li>Social Media and Sharing - The rise of social media platforms made hyperlinks an important tool for
              sharing content and promoting information.

          <ul>
            <li>Knowledge Organization - In education and academic research, hyperlinks are used to connect relevant
              concepts and reference materials, facilitating the organization and dissemination of knowledge.

              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Online Navigation - Hyperlinks serve as navigation tools, helping users quickly jump between websites
              and pages, improving the efficiency of information retrieval.

            </li>
            <li>Interactive Storytelling - In the digital media and journalism industry, hyperlinks are used to create
              interactive stories, allowing users to delve deeper into more details according to their interests.</li>

          <div class="title">Hyperlink restricted</div>
          <p>Recent innovations such as Single Page Applications (SPAs), mobile apps, and social media are changing the
            way we use hyperlinks, which may, to some extent, undermine hyperlinks and the user autonomy they support.
            In SPAs, user interactions with the page no longer require the entire page to be reloaded, reducing the use
            of hyperlinks in the traditional sense. Mobile apps, through their built-in navigation and interface design,
            allow users to transition within the app rather than through hyperlinks. Social media platforms, with their
            closed content ecosystems, restrict the flow of external links, thus also affecting the traditional function
            of hyperlinks. These changes may limit users' ability to freely explore the internet, as they are more
            directed in consuming information along specific paths.</p>
