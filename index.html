          <p>Hyperlinks, usually called links, are a foundational concept behind the Web. To explain what links are, we
            need to step back to the very basics of Web architecture.</p>
          <p>Back in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, the Web's inventor, spoke of the three pillars on which the Web stands:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>URL, an address system that keeps track of Web documents</li>
            <li>HTTP, a transfer protocol to find documents when given their URLs
            </li>
            <li>HTML, a document format allowing for embedded <em>hyperlinks</em>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>As you can see in the three pillars, everything on the Web revolves around documents and how to access
            them.
            The Web's original purpose was to provide an easy way to reach, read, and navigate through text documents.
            Since then, the Web has evolved to provide access to images, videos, and binary data, but these improvements
            have hardly changed the three pillars.</p>
          <p>Before the Web, it was quite hard to access documents and move from one to another. Being human-readable,
            URLs already made things easier, but it's hard to type a long URL whenever you want to access a document.
            This
            is where hyperlinks revolutionized everything. Links can correlate any text string with a URL, such that the
            user can instantly reach the target document by activating the link.</p>
          <p>Links stand out from the surrounding text by being underlined and in blue text. Tap or click a link to
            activate it, or if you use a keyboard, press Tab until the link is in focus and hit Enter or Spacebar.</p>

          <p>Links are the breakthrough that made the Web so useful and successful. In the rest of this article, we
            discuss the various types of links and their importance to modern Web design.</p>

              <p>A link between two webpages, where both webpages belong to the same website, is called an internal
                link. Without internal links, there's no such thing as a website (unless, of course, it's a one-page
                website).</p>

            <dd>
              <p>A link from your webpage to someone else's webpage. Without external links, there is no Web, since the
                Web is a network of webpages. Use external links to provide information besides the content available
                through your webpage.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt id="incoming_links"><a href="#incoming_links">Incoming links</a></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>A link from someone else's webpage to your site. It's the opposite of an external link. Note that you
                don't have to link back when someone links to your site.</p>

            <dd>
              <p>Most links tie two webpages together. <strong>Anchors</strong> tie two sections of one document
                together. When you follow a link pointing to an anchor, your browser jumps to another part of the
                current document instead of loading a new document. However, you make and use anchors the same way as
                other links.</p>
