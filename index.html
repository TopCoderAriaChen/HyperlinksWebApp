              <h2>What are Hyperlinks? </h2>
              <p> 
                 Hyperlinks, usually called links, are the threads that weave together 
                 the World Wide Web, creating an intricate tapestry of interconnected resources. 
                 To explain what links are, we need to step back to the very basics of Web architecture.<br />
                 At their core, links are directives embedded within web pages that guide users and browsers from one digital
                 destination to another. <br />
                 The inception of the web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 was marked by the introduction 
                 of three fundamental technologies:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>URL which serve as unique identifiers for resources</li>
                <li>HTTP as the protocol for transferring data across the web
                </li>
                <li>that structures content and enables the creation of <em>hyperlinks</em>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Together, these components constructed the bedrock of the internet's navigational capabilities.</p>
              <p>
                In the web development context, hyperlinks are more than just pathways; they encapsulate user interaction, 
                design paradigms, and the very essence of browsing. Although traditional hyperlinks initiate GET requests to 
                retrieve documents, modern web applications often require a more dynamic approach. Here, AJAX (Asynchronous 
                JavaScript and XML) comes into play, allowing for seamless interactions by making background HTTP requests 
                without refreshing the entire page. This methodology enriches the user experience, fostering the development 
                of responsive and adaptive web applications that react in real time to user input.
              </p>
              </ol>
              <div class="notecard note">
              <p><h3>Note on Hyperlink Implementations:</h3></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                  Traditional hyperlinks are constrained to GET requests, such as when a user clicks a link to download a document. 
                  They cannot perform actions like POST or DELETE, which are essential in web applications for creating and removing 
                  content. To bridge this gap, AJAX enables asynchronous interactions, providing a means to achieve partial page 
                  refreshing. This functionality is key in creating sophisticated web experiences, such as single-page applications 
                  that maintain a fluid user interface while communicating with the server in the background. Modern implementations 
                  often utilize the Fetch API.
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax, or AJAX) is a web development technique in which a web app
                        fetches content from the server by making asynchronous HTTP requests, and uses the new content to
                        update the relevant parts of the page without requiring a full page load. This can make the page more
                        responsive, because only the parts that need to be updated are requested.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Ajax can be used to create single-page apps, in which the entire web app consists of a single
                        document, which uses Ajax to update its content as needed.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Initially Ajax was implemented using the XMLHttpRequest interface, but the fetch() API is more
                        suitable for modern web applications: it is more powerful, more flexible, and integrates better with
                        fundamental web app technologies such as service workers. Modern web frameworks also provide
                        abstractions for Ajax.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Explore the examples below to see how hyperlinks and AJAX facilitate seamless web navigation and content management:</h3>
                    <span class="arrow"></span>
                  </div>
                  <div class="fold-body">
                    <p>Consider the following scenarios: All visitors can see a public message, but for user-specific data, 
                      we might want to tailor the content. Here's how hyperlinks and AJAX work in tandem to create a differentiated 
                      user experience. Below is an interactive example using AJAX to conditionally display content based on the 
                      user's identity.<br />
                      For example, while all users can see this message, User A cannot see this information.<br />
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <strong> Using hyperlinks, we can direct users based on URL query parameters. For instance, if the URL contains 
                          the parameter "name" with a value of "A", then it can conditionally hide content when the page loads.</strong>
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <pre>

                      <a href="/index.html?name=A">"Try it out"</a>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                    <br />
                      <li>
                        <strong> Using AJAX, we can update the content dynamically based on user actions or data conditions, such as hiding content if a user with a specific ID is detected. 
                        In this example, if the requested data contains an ID of 1, then hide the content.</strong>
                      </li>

                <p>An internal link connects two pages within the same website. Websites, excluding those that consist
                   of a single page, rely heavily on internal links to function.</p>

              <dd>
                <p>An external link connects a page on your website to a page on another website. The Web is essentially a 
                  network of such links, which is vital for expanding the information beyond what is available on your own site.</p>
                <br />

              <dt id="incoming_links"><a href="#incoming_links">Incoming links</a></dt>
              <dd>
                <p>These are links from other websites directing users to your website, essentially the reverse of an
                   external link. Importantly, you're not required to reciprocate these links.</p>

              <dd>
                <p>
                  Unlike typical links that connect separate webpages,  <strong>Anchors</strong> tie two sections of one document
                  together. When you follow a link pointing to an anchor, your browser jumps to another part of the
                  current document instead of loading a new document. However, you make and use anchors the same way as
                  other links.
