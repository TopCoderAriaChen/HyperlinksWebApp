# Understanding Hyperlinks Website

## Overview

This project delves into the history of the web with a focus on the evolution of the hyperlinkâ€”a fundamental component that has powered innovations and transformed the way we navigate and interact with information online. The website is a result of extensive research and is designed to demonstrate the application of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a touch of Bootstrap and jQuery to provide a unique user experience.

## Structure

The website is organized into three distinct sections, each presenting a different facet of hyperlinks:

### Section One: Understanding Hyperlinks
This section offers an in-depth look at the concept of hyperlinks, their implementation, and their function from both the web developer's and the browser's perspective. It features interactive examples using AJAX calls to public APIs, as well as visual aids to engage and educate visitors on the technical and practical aspects of hyperlinks.

### Section Two: The Historical Journey of Hyperlinks
Here, the narrative traces the origin and development of hyperlinks. Starting from the 1960s to the modern era of the internet, it identifies key milestones and technologies that have shaped their use. This part encourages interactive learning, with a rich blend of styles and media elements that react to user interactions.

### Section Three: Author's Biography
The final section presents a personal touch, featuring a brief biography of the author, Aria Chen. It showcases a curriculum vitae format, using advanced HTML and CSS techniques, and introduces the author to the teaching team with a professional and interactive profile.

## Technical Highlights
